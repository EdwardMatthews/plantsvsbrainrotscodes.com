                <h2>Understanding PvB Plants and Their Mechanics</h2>
                <p>Plants vs Brainrots plants serve as your main defensive units, with each PvB plant bringing distinct abilities to the battlefield. Whether you're deploying basic Eggplants during early waves or unleashing mythical Carnivorous Plants against bosses, mastering Plants vs Brainrots plants is essential. This guide breaks down every plant in Plants vs Brainrots, covering rarities, abilities, mutations, and proven strategies that experienced players use to dominate.</p>

                <p>PvB plants follow a rarity system where legendary and mythic Plants vs Brainrots plants outperform common variants but cost significantly more. You'll get most Plants vs Brainrots plants from NPC George's shop, which refreshes every 4 minutes and 40 seconds, though trading with other players works too. The mutation system makes even basic PvB plants valuable, since any seed you plant might develop game-changing mutations that transform ordinary plants into powerhouses.</p>

                            Mr. Carrot ranks among the best Plants vs Brainrots plants you can get, earning legendary status through ridiculous single-target damage. This PvB plant's armor-piercing rounds tear through tanky Brainrots and bosses alike. Position Mr. Carrot correctly among your other Plants vs Brainrots plants, and watch it delete priority targets before they even get close. The combination of rapid attacks and extended range makes this one of those PvB plants that stays relevant from mid-game through endgame content.

                            Watermelon dominates as one of the most practical Plants vs Brainrots plants for crowd control.

Among epic-tier Plants vs Brainrots plants, Watermelon offers the best balance of cost and effectiveness for handling swarm waves. The splash damage means this PvB plant contributes damage even when enemies spread out, making it more reliable than many single-target plants.

Among all Plants vs Brainrots plants, few match Cocotank's versatility in anchoring defense lines while still dealing relevant damage. The massive range lets this PvB plant start hitting enemies early, weakening waves before they reach your squishier plants.

                            Sunflower might seem basic among Plants vs Brainrots plants, but its mutation potential changes everything. Standard Sunflowers work fine as budget PvB plants, but mutations turn them into completely different units. Frozen Sunflower mutations slow entire waves, while Giant variants tank like epic-tier Plants vs Brainrots plants. Since Sunflowers drop frequently, they're perfect for players wanting strong PvB plants without breaking the bank on premium seeds.

                            <p>Spam plant Sunflowers with Lucky Potions active to fish for mutations on these PvB plants. Replace normal versions with mutated Plants vs Brainrots plants as you get them. Frozen variants counter speed-based enemies, while giants tank the frontline. Few PvB plants offer this much flexibility at such low cost.</p>

                <h2>How Mutations Transform PvB Plants</h2>
                <p>The mutation system can turn any Plants vs Brainrots plant into something special. Every seed you plant has mutation potential that can completely change how that PvB plant performs:</p>

                <div class="mutation-types">
                    <div class="mutation-card">
                        <h3>❄️ Frozen Mutation</h3>
                        <p>Makes Plants vs Brainrots plants slow enemies by 30-50% per hit. Frozen PvB plants excel against speedsters and bosses where movement control matters most.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="mutation-card">
                        <h3>🔥 Burning Mutation</h3>
                        <p>Inflicts damage over time on hit enemies. Burn damage stacks with multiple hits, making it excellent for high-attack-speed plants.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="mutation-card">
                        <h3>📏 Giant Mutation</h3>
                        <p>Scales PvB plants up by 50-200%, multiplying health and damage accordingly. Giant Plants vs Brainrots plants become walls that also hit hard.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="mutation-card">
                        <h3>⚡ Speed Mutation</h3>
                        <p>Enhances attack speed by 25-40%. Speed mutations turn moderate damage dealers into rapid-fire defensive platforms.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="mutation-card">
                        <h3>💎 Crystal Mutation</h3>
                        <p>Boosts all stats on Plants vs Brainrots plants by 15-25%. Crystal PvB plants look amazing and perform even better.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="mutation-card">
                        <h3>🌈 Rainbow Mutation</h3>
                        <p>The jackpot for PvB plants - combines 2-3 mutations on one Plants vs Brainrots plant. Rainbow units break the game's balance completely.</p>

                    <h3>Maximizing Mutation Chances</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Use Lucky Potions before planting expensive or rare seeds</li>
                        <li>Higher rebirth levels increase base mutation rates</li>
                        <li>Plant during special events that boost mutation chances</li>
                        <li>Maintain high luck stat through equipment and upgrades</li>
                        <li>Plant multiple seeds simultaneously to improve odds</li>
                        <li>Some fusion recipes preserve or enhance mutations</li>

                    <h3>Early Game (0-500 Spawns)</h3>
                    <p>Build your Plants vs Brainrots plants collection with commons and rares first. Cover all lanes with basic PvB plants before chasing power units. Eggplants and Sunflowers will be most of your Plants vs Brainrots plants early on. Spend cash on plot expansion instead of gambling for rare PvB plants. Learn the enemy patterns while your starter plants hold the line.</p>

                    <p>Start adding epic PvB plants to your roster as cash flows improve. Target specific Plants vs Brainrots plants like Watermelon that fill gaps in your strategy. Test different PvB plant combinations to find synergies. Save up for rebirth - it unlocks fusion and accelerates everything. Pick Plants vs Brainrots plants that stay relevant after rebirthing.</p>

Master fusing PvB plants into hybrids that dominate. Perfect your Plants vs Brainrots plants placement for maximum coverage. Hunt mutations on your core units. Grind events for exclusive PvB plants you can't get elsewhere.</p>
