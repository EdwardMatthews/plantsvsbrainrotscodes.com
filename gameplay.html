            <h2>What is Plants vs Brainrots?</h2>
            <p>Plants vs Brainrots is an innovative Roblox tower defense game developed by Yo Gurt Studio that reimagines the classic Plants vs. Zombies formula through modern internet meme culture. Unlike traditional tower defense games, Plants vs Brainrots combines defensive gameplay with a unique income generation system where defeated enemies become valuable assets for your progression.</p>

            <p>When you start playing Plants vs Brainrots for the first time, you'll discover a game that blends strategic plant placement, resource management, and an engaging rebirth system that keeps players coming back for more. The game features no permanent failure states, meaning even if brainrots breach your defenses, you can continue playing and improving your strategy.</p>

            <div class="tip-box">
                <h3>💡 Quick Start Tip</h3>
                <p>New to Plants vs Brainrots? Focus on understanding the basic mechanics first: plant seeds to defend, collect defeated brainrots for income, and use that income to buy better plants. The game rewards patience and strategic thinking over rushing.</p>
            </div>

        <section class="gameplay-section">
            <h2>How to Play Plants vs Brainrots - Basic Tutorial</h2>

            <div class="mechanic-card">
                <h3>Step 1: Starting Your Journey</h3>
                <p>Every player in Plants vs Brainrots begins with $400 in their account. This starting capital is crucial for establishing your initial defense. During the tutorial, you'll use this money to purchase your first seeds from NPC George, who manages the seed shop. George's stock refreshes every 4 minutes and 40 seconds, so timing your purchases can be strategic.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="mechanic-card">
                <h3>Step 2: Planting Your Defense</h3>
                <p>To defend your garden in Plants vs Brainrots, buy seeds and plant them strategically. Each plant type offers unique attack patterns and defensive capabilities. Remember that rarer plants take longer to grow but provide better defensive capabilities. When you plant a seed, there's a chance it will grow with a mutation that enhances its damage output and changes its appearance.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="mechanic-card">
                <h3>Step 3: Fighting Brainrot Waves</h3>
                <p>Brainrots attack your garden through lanes, similar to traditional tower defense games. Your plants automatically engage these enemies as they approach. Successfully defeating brainrots is essential not just for defense but for building your economy, as each defeated brainrot can be converted into a passive income source.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="mechanic-card">
                <h3>Step 4: Income Generation System</h3>
                <p>The unique aspect of Plants vs Brainrots gameplay is the income generation mechanic. Defeated brainrots don't disappear - they join your inventory. Place these brainrots on platforms in your base to generate continuous income, even when you're offline (at reduced rates). For example, a Normal Noobini Bananini generates $2 per second, while its Gold variant offers $8 per second.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="mechanic-card">
                <h3>Step 5: Expanding Your Base</h3>
                <p>As you accumulate wealth in Plants vs Brainrots, invest in unlocking more garden plots for plants and additional platforms for brainrots. This expansion is crucial for handling tougher waves and maximizing your income generation. Balance your spending between defensive upgrades and economic expansion for optimal progression.</p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section class="gameplay-section">
            <h2>Wave Mechanics & Defense Strategies</h2>

            <h3>Understanding Wave Patterns</h3>
            <p>In Plants vs Brainrots, brainrot waves follow predictable patterns that increase in difficulty over time. Each wave introduces different brainrot types with varying health pools, speeds, and special abilities. Understanding these patterns helps you prepare appropriate defenses before each wave arrives.</p>

            <h3>Lane Management</h3>
            <p>The lane-based system in Plants vs Brainrots requires strategic thinking about plant placement. Focus your strongest plants in central lanes where brainrots typically concentrate. Keep cheaper, fast-attacking plants in outer lanes to handle stragglers. This defensive formation maximizes your damage output while conserving resources.</p>

            <h3>Strategic Plant Placement</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Choke Point Strategy:</strong> Position your most powerful plants where brainrots naturally bunch up</li>
                <li><strong>Layered Defense:</strong> Create multiple lines of defense with varying plant types</li>
                <li><strong>Emergency Reserves:</strong> Always keep some cheaper plants ready to reinforce weak spots</li>
                <li><strong>Mutation Priority:</strong> Prioritize planting when you have luck boosts for better mutation chances</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="warning-box">
                <h3>⚠️ Common Mistake to Avoid</h3>
                <p>Don't spend all your money on expensive plants immediately. Maintain a 70/30 split between brainrot income investment and plant purchases to ensure sustainable growth in Plants vs Brainrots.</p>
            </div>

        <section class="gameplay-section">
            <h2>Boss Battle Mechanics in Plants vs Brainrots</h2>

            <h3>Boss Spawning System</h3>
            <p>Boss battles in Plants vs Brainrots occur after every 500 brainrot spawns. The first boss, Hotspotini Burrito, is available to all players regardless of rebirth level. Higher-tier bosses require specific rebirth levels to unlock, making progression essential for accessing endgame content.</p>

            <h3>How to Defeat Bosses Effectively</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Preparation Phase:</strong> Before reaching 500 spawns, ensure all lanes have mythical or higher-tier plants</li>
                <li><strong>Mutation Advantage:</strong> Larger plants with mutations deal significantly more damage to bosses</li>
                <li><strong>Gear Usage:</strong> Utilize Frost Grenades to stun bosses while your plants deal damage</li>
                <li><strong>Speed Potions:</strong> Use these to accelerate spawn rates and reach boss battles faster</li>
                <li><strong>Lane Coverage:</strong> Bosses may attack multiple lanes, so ensure complete defensive coverage</li>
            </ol>

            <div class="tip-box">
                <h3>💡 Boss Farming Strategy</h3>
                <p>To maximize boss farming efficiency in Plants vs Brainrots, focus on increasing your brainrot kill count quickly. Use Speed Potions to accelerate spawn rates and reach the 500-spawn threshold faster. Remember that boss rewards scale with your rebirth level, so progress through rebirths for better loot.</p>

            <h2>Mutation System Explained</h2>

            <h3>How Mutations Work in Plants vs Brainrots</h3>
            <p>The mutation system adds a layer of RNG excitement to Plants vs Brainrots gameplay. When planting seeds or capturing brainrots, there's a chance they'll receive mutations that significantly boost their effectiveness. Understanding and maximizing mutations is key to progressing efficiently through the game.</p>

            <h3>Plant Mutations</h3>
            <p>Plants in Plants vs Brainrots can receive mutations when grown from seeds. These mutations provide damage multipliers and visual changes. Since you cannot level up plants directly, mutations are the only way to enhance their combat effectiveness beyond their base stats.</p>

            <h3>Brainrot Mutations</h3>
            <p>Captured brainrots can also have mutations that affect their income generation rates. The same multipliers that apply to plant damage apply to brainrot income, making mutated brainrots extremely valuable for your economy. Always prioritize keeping larger, mutated brainrots over smaller duplicates.</p>

            <h3>Increasing Mutation Chances</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Lucky Potions:</strong> Temporarily boost mutation chances for both plants and brainrots</li>
                <li><strong>Rebirth Bonuses:</strong> Each rebirth permanently increases your luck stat</li>
                <li><strong>Timing Strategy:</strong> Plant seeds during luck boost periods for maximum efficiency</li>
                <li><strong>Volume Approach:</strong> Plant multiple seeds simultaneously during luck boosts</li>

            <h2>Rebirth System & Progression Guide</h2>

            <h3>Understanding the Rebirth Mechanic</h3>
            <p>The rebirth system in Plants vs Brainrots provides the primary progression path for dedicated players. While rebirthing resets your cash and brainrots, it grants permanent bonuses that accelerate future gameplay sessions. Each rebirth provides a 50% boost to money earned and luck for rare spawns, with these bonuses stacking multiplicatively.</p>

            <h2>Advanced Strategies for Plants vs Brainrots</h2>

            <h3>Economy Management</h3>
            <p>Successful Plants vs Brainrots gameplay requires balancing immediate defense needs with long-term economic growth. Follow these advanced economic strategies:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Income Priority:</strong> Always place high-earning brainrots on platforms before selling duplicates</li>
                <li><strong>Platform Jumping:</strong> Regularly collect earnings by jumping on brainrot platforms</li>
                <li><strong>Investment Ratio:</strong> Maintain 70% income generation, 30% defensive spending</li>
                <li><strong>Compound Growth:</strong> Reinvest early earnings into more brainrot slots for exponential growth</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Optimal Plant Progression Path</h3>
            <p>For new players wondering how to progress efficiently in Plants vs Brainrots, follow this recommended plant acquisition order:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Start with Cactus for basic defense</li>
                <li>Add Strawberry plants for area damage</li>
                <li>Save for Pumpkin as your first major upgrade</li>
                <li>Prioritize mutated versions over higher normal tiers</li>
                <li>Focus on mythical plants once you have steady income</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Pity System Exploitation</h3>
            <p>Plants vs Brainrots features a pity system guaranteeing legendary brainrots every 100 spawns and mythic brainrots every 500 spawns. Track your spawn count and prepare capture strategies when approaching these milestones. Use luck potions near pity thresholds to potentially trigger multiple rare spawns.</p>

            <h3>Offline Income Optimization</h3>
            <p>The game continues generating income while offline, though at reduced rates. Before logging off from Plants vs Brainrots, ensure all your highest-earning brainrots are placed on platforms. Arrange them efficiently to maximize passive income during your absence.</p>

            <h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>

            <div class="warning-box">
                <h3>⚠️ Beginner Pitfalls</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Overspending on Plants:</strong> Don't neglect income generation for pure defense</li>
                    <li><strong>Ignoring Mutations:</strong> A mutated common plant often outperforms a normal rare plant</li>
                    <li><strong>Late Rebirthing:</strong> Delaying rebirths slows overall progression significantly</li>
                    <li><strong>Poor Lane Coverage:</strong> Leaving lanes undefended leads to income loss</li>
                    <li><strong>Selling Mutated Brainrots:</strong> Always keep mutated versions for higher income</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>Resource Management Errors</h3>
            <p>Many players learning how to play Plants vs Brainrots make critical resource management mistakes. Avoid selling rare brainrots for quick cash when they generate more value over time on platforms. Similarly, don't waste gear items on regular waves - save them for boss battles or emergency situations.</p>

            <h3>Strategic Oversights</h3>
            <p>Players often overlook the importance of the rebirth system in Plants vs Brainrots, trying to accumulate massive wealth before their first rebirth.
